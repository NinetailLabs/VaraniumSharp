A very simple helper library with the goal of having reusable, reliable components.

With the release of VaraniumSharp 2.0.0 we are moving over to .NetStandard2.0 as this supports all .Net 4.6.1+ framework libraries and grants the ability to make use of DotNet Core2.0+
If an older version is required please file an issue and request support, we're willing to multi-target to older platforms where possible (Note that DotNet Core 1.x cannot be supported due to missing libraries)

For a detailed overview of the library see our [documentation](https://ninetaillabs.github.io/VaraniumSharp/index.html)
